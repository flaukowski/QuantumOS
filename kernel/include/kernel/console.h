/**
 * QuantumOS Console Input/Output (epic #62 phase 1, #63)
 *
 * The interactive half of the boot console. Output has always existed
 * (early_console_write in boot.S, polled COM1 TX); this adds INPUT: an
 * interrupt-driven ring buffer fed by two producers —
 *
 *   - COM1 RX (IRQ4): bytes typed into the serial console (QEMU
 *     -serial stdio, the qBraid watch window, CI's piped stdin), and
 *   - the PS/2 keyboard (IRQ1): scancode set 1 translated to ASCII,
 *     for interactive/graphical boots.
 *
 * Ring 3 reaches the console through SYS_CONS, guarded as a capability
 * resource (CAP_RESOURCE_DEVICE over DEVICE_ID_CONSOLE) exactly like the
 * COM2 swarm bridge: no capability, no console. console_write() is the
 * raw byte sink for the shell — unlike SYS_WRITE it adds no "[user pid]"
 * prefix, so a ring-3 shell can own its own line discipline.
