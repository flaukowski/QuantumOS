"""Bring-your-own-model ↔ QuantumOS: a BYO-key agent that drives a live
QuantumOS VM through its FROZEN MCP tool surface (ADR-0020 lane B, contracts/
mcp/v1-tools.json). An external model is exactly the consumer that freeze was
built for — so this script REUSES scripts/qos_mcp.py verbatim rather than
duplicating a single tool definition. One source of truth: the same 22 tools
CI diffs against the golden are the tools your model sees.

Any model, your choice of provider:

    --provider anthropic   (default) Claude, via the Anthropic SDK's
                           tool_runner + MCP conversion helpers
    --provider openai      ANY OpenAI-compatible /chat/completions endpoint:
                           OpenAI itself, OpenRouter, Groq, DeepSeek, Mistral,
                           LM Studio, llama.cpp server — or a keyless local
                           Ollama (--base-url http://localhost:11434/v1)

Architecture (all local, no hosted anything):

    your model (your key — or no key at all for a local server)
        │  provider-specific agentic loop
        ▼
    MCP tool conversion (anthropic helpers / plain function-calling)
        │  stdio
        ▼
    scripts/qos_mcp.py  (FastMCP, unmodified)
        │  thin delegation
        ▼
    qos_bridge.QosVM / QosSociety  →  QEMU  →  QuantumOS

The key never leaves your machine; the VM never leaves your machine. The model
plans and runs field-society / associative-memory experiments over the wire,
reads the results, and iterates.

HONESTY (mirrors qos_mcp.py's module docstring): a tool result's `verified`
means the boot attestation is self-consistent (frames + Lamport signature +
qseed), NOT that the VM is live-now — a captured attestation replays. Only the
key-admitted STATUS reply is per-request nonce+HMAC fresh. The system prompt
tells the model this so it never overstates what a result proves.

Run:
    # 1. build the guest once (produces build/x86_64/kernel.elf32)
    make kernel
    # 2. install deps
    pip install -r requirements-agent.txt

    # Claude (default) — bring Anthropic credentials, either works:
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...        # or: ant auth login
    python3 scripts/qos_agent.py "Boot a VM and imprint three phrases, then recall a corrupted probe of the first."

    # any OpenAI-compatible provider:
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
    python3 scripts/qos_agent.py --provider openai --model gpt-5.1 --experiment society

    # a local model, no key at all:
    python3 scripts/qos_agent.py --provider openai --model llama3.3 \
        --base-url http://localhost:11434/v1

    # prove the MCP handshake without spending a token / needing a key:
    python3 scripts/qos_agent.py --list-tools

Deps: requirements-agent.txt (anthropic[mcp], openai, mcp) — each provider SDK
is imported only when that provider is selected. Python >= 3.10.

SYSTEM = """You are an experimentalist driving a live QuantumOS instance — a \
capability-secured microkernel whose kernel hosts a Hopfield–Kuramoto \
associative-memory field ("ghostd"), quantum-seeded entropy, and multi-node \
"field societies" that couple over the wire. You act only through the provided \
QuantumOS tools; there is no shell.

What you can do: boot and shut down VMs; imprint and recall associative \
memories at the kernel field and read that field's live state; form N-node \
societies (3–4 members) that mean-field-synchronize and exchange qseed-salted \
aggregates; draw quantum-seeded entropy; run citizens off the initrd; read \
machine snapshots; and bridge memories to/from the host Kannaka HRM.

Method: state your hypothesis, run the smallest experiment that tests it, read \
the actual tool results (do not assume — a boot can fail, a recall can miss), \
and iterate. Prefer one clear result over an exhaustive sweep.

Honesty about trust — this matters: a result's `verified` flag means the boot \
attestation is internally consistent (frames + Lamport signature + qseed), NOT \
that the VM is live at read time; a captured attestation replays. Only a \
key-admitted STATUS reply is per-request authenticated. Never describe an \
ordinary tool result as cryptographically attested data. Report what the field \
did, plainly, and distinguish measured from inferred.

Operational: booting a VM or a society takes tens of seconds to a few minutes \
— that is normal, not a hang. Always shut down what you booted before ending, \
even on failure. When done, give a plain-language readout: what you ran, what \
the field did, and what it demonstrates."""
