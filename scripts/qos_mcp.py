"""
QuantumOS MCP server (epics #99, #125): expose a running QuantumOS to agents
as tools. Any MCP-speaking agent can boot a VM; query its ghostd field; imprint
and recall associative memories at the kernel field; inspect that field
read-only (live slots, energy, eviction); run a citizen off the initrd (with
arguments); read a structured machine snapshot (uptime, memory, process, date); draw quantum-seeded entropy; write/rm/sync overlay files;
have the OS fetch a URL over its own TCP stack; bridge memories to/from the host
Kannaka HRM (epic #127); and shut it down — every result carrying the boot's
Lamport-verified identity.

This is a THIN wrapper: all logic (framing, attestation, the QEMU lifecycle,
the verified-gate) lives in qos_bridge.QosVM. The tools here are one-line
delegations, so the CI test in test_qos_mcp.py exercises the very same code
path these tools take. Only this file imports `mcp`; qos_bridge stays
stdlib-only so the integration CI (no mcp package) can test the bridge.

HONESTY: `identity()` in every result documents that `verified` means the
boot attestation's frames + Lamport signature + qseed are consistent — NOT
that the VM is live-now (a captured attestation replays) and NOT that a
STATUS/RECALL reply is individually authenticated (DATA traffic is unsigned).
Trust equals control of the VM's serial channel, the same class as holding
the console. Do not present tool results as cryptographically attested data.

Run:  python3 scripts/qos_mcp.py       (stdio transport)
Dep:  mcp>=1.0  (Python >=3.10)
