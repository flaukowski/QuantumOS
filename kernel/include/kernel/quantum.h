/**
 * QuantumOS Quantum Resource Management (#4)
 *
 * Qubits, coherence windows, and quantum execution contexts as
 * first-class, capability-guarded OS resources. The current backend is
 * a deterministic in-kernel simulator (integer-only: fidelity in
 * basis points, coherence in timer ticks, measurements from a seeded
 * xorshift PRNG); the API is written against the quantum_types.h
 * shapes so hardware backends slot in behind it later.
 *
 * Access control: every operation takes (pid, cap_id) and validates a
 * CAP_RESOURCE_QUANTUM capability on the shared pool via cap_check —
 * no ambient authority.
