 * QuantumOS Preemptive Scheduler

 * Round-robin preemptive scheduler driven by the PIT timer tick.
 * Context switching is done on the interrupt frame: on a scheduling
 * tick the saved cpu_state_t of the interrupted process is written to
 * its PCB and the next process's saved state is written back onto the
 * frame, so the iretq at the end of irq_common resumes the next
 * process directly.

 * picked out of turn at the next reschedule (default round-robin arm only),
 * collapsing a COM2 hop from ~one full rotation (~450 ms at rest) to

 * resets the global quantum counter — keep quantum expiry (and preempt_count,
 * and the watchdog's turn) from ever firing. K=2 guarantees >=1 plain pick
 * per 3, so a rotation of N runnable completes within ~3N picks and max_gap
 * stays within a small multiple of today's envelope (refereed by the armed
 * maxgap ceiling in ci-smoke-sched); a 1-boost PING hop rides through
