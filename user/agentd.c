/**
 * QuantumOS agentd — the agent-native end-to-end demo (the mission showcase).
 *
 * One ring-3 citizen that exercises the whole agentic stack in a single story,
 * each step with a verifiable outcome (agentd carries no engine of its own — the
 * results can only have come back through the kernel's brokers):
 *
 *   1. QPU      — submits a Bell circuit through the SYS_QPU broker and checks
 *                 the EXACT probability qpud computed, p(00) = 1/2.
 *   2. FIELD    — imprints a phrase into holographic field region 3 and recalls
 *                 it from a deterministically CORRUPTED probe (wave-interference
 *                 associative memory), verifying the exact stored bytes return.
 *   3. SPAWN    — starts /bin/hello as a sub-process and waits for it to exit
 *                 (real spawn authority — only a citizen holding the cap can).
 *   4. DELEGATE — hands a strictly-NARROWED READ-only slice of its region-3 field
 *                 cap to a SOCIETY of AGENT_SUBS sub-agents (agentsub) via
 *                 SYS_CAP_DERIVE, each over its own capability-checked IPC pair;
 *                 every sub-agent recalls the phrase from its OWN pid-salted
 *                 noisy probe and acks the DIGEST of what it recalled; the
 *                 orchestrator requires a matching digest from each distinct
 *                 delegate (content consensus, deduped by vouched sender pid).
 *                 This is "an orchestrator hands a narrowed intent to each of
 *                 several sub-agents" — a one-hop fan-out tree (CAP_GRANT never
 *                 handed over, so no sub can re-delegate).
 *
 * On all four it prints the single CI merge-gate line
 *   AGENTD: DEMO OK qpu+field+spawn+society
 * Grants: qpu_submit(quota) + field(region 3) + field_delegable + spawn. NOT
 * monitored (a watchdog respawn would re-run the one-shot proof); exits after.
