# Architecture Decision Records

This directory records the architectural decisions behind QuantumOS — both **as-built**
(decisions already shipped and gated in CI, status *Accepted*) and **next-phase**
(decisions being adopted, status *Accepted* for work in flight or *Proposed* for planned
work). Each ADR carries `file:line` and PR evidence you can check against the tree.

The as-built ADRs were reconciled from a full ground-truth inventory of the 126 merged
PRs (#7–#183) at main. The next-phase ADRs were produced by an adversarial design panel
(2026-07-11) that attacked eight candidate directions against the real code; its
verdicts — adopt the authenticated swarm plane, the v1 freeze, and honest memory; reject
SMP; defer UEFI, a libagent extraction, and a block filesystem — are recorded here.

## Sequencing of the next phases

1. **ADR-0018 (now)** — release + package at 0.x. No contract freeze.
2. **ADR-0019** — authenticate the swarm plane. Extends the COM2/attestation contracts,
   so it must precede any freeze.
3. **ADR-0020** — freeze the v1 contracts, after 0019's wire changes settle and the
   pre-freeze fixes land.
4. **ADR-0021** — honest memory to 1 GB, standalone; also closes two verified latent
   defects (the PMM/kheap reservation gap and the Multiboot2-magic trap).

Deferred (panel verdicts, no ADR yet): UEFI boot (revisit at a real CSM-less target),
a `libagent` extraction (needs a second orchestrator consumer + actor-bearing audit
records), and a block/log filesystem (no agent-native consumer needs partial writes).

## Format

Each ADR follows: a number and title; a date and status; **Context** (the forces),
**Decision** (what was chosen), **Consequences** (positive, negative, and residual risks —
honest negatives are mandatory), and **Evidence** (shipping PRs, `file:line` anchors, and
the CI gates that prove it). New ADRs take the next free number and never renumber existing
ones.
