/**
 * QuantumOS Capability Authority Ledger (epic #133 — Phase D)
 *
 * A kernel-authoritative, append-only record of capability GRANTs, DENIALs, and
 * SPAWNs. The KERNEL writes it — a ring-3 citizen cannot forge or suppress its
 * own entry — so an external verifier can see what authority each agent holds
 * and every attempt to exceed it. This is the "conscience before wallet"
 * substrate: reliability = faithfulness to granted intent, made observable.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE: this is an AUTHORITY LEDGER, NOT a full syscall/action trace.
 * It records GRANT (a capability minted for a pid), DENY (a capability-gated
 * syscall refused because the caller lacked the right), SPAWN (a process
 * created), REVOKE (a capability explicitly withdrawn via cap_revoke, incl.
 * its cascade), and REAP (slots freed because their owner died — the reaper's
 * cap_revoke_all_for_process + its cascade). It does NOT record successful
 * exercise of already-held authority. EXPIRE is still not recorded: expired
 * caps are never freed — they are refused at check/find/derive time and the
 * slot is reclaimed only by owner death (recorded then as REAP), so the
 * absence of an EXPIRE entry does not mean the cap was live until revoked.
 * TRANSFER is not recorded (cap_transfer currently has no caller). GRANT/
 * REVOKE/REAP record the pid whose HOLDINGS changed, NOT the requester — a
 * forced ancestor revoke is indistinguishable from a self-revoke; before
 * SYS_CAP_REVOKE is ever exposed to ring 3, the denied path MUST audit_deny
 * and the forced path needs an actor-bearing record. DENY coverage is the set
 * of cap-gated syscalls hooked in syscall.c (quantum, com2, console, field,
 * spawn); IPC and net ownership denials are not yet logged (documented gap).
 *
 * CONCURRENCY: audit_record is called from BOTH syscall context AND the IF=1
 * service health monitor (a watchdog-reborn citizen re-mints caps from that
 * thread — service.c). So unlike field.c it does NOT assume a cli'd caller: the
 * ring append + monotonic seq bump are self-contained under a local
 * irqsave/irqrestore. Single CPU, so that suffices.
