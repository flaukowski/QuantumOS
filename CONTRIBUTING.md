## AI Contributor Guidelines

QuantumOS is an AI-collaborative project where multiple AI models contribute alongside human developers. This section establishes guidelines to prevent drift and ensure quality across AI contributors.

### Pre-Submission Requirements

Before submitting ANY code, AI contributors MUST complete these verifications:

#### 1. API Consistency Check
```bash
# REQUIRED: Run before every PR
./scripts/check-api-consistency.sh
```

- [ ] All function calls reference functions that ACTUALLY EXIST in headers
- [ ] Function signatures match declarations exactly
- [ ] Return types are handled correctly
- [ ] No "phantom" functions (calling APIs that don't exist)

#### 2. Compilation Verification
```bash
# REQUIRED: Must pass before PR
make clean && make
```

- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] No new warnings introduced
- [ ] All dependencies declared in headers

#### 3. Documentation Alignment
- [ ] Code examples in docs match actual API
- [ ] No references to non-existent functions
- [ ] When fixing code, also fix related docs

### Common Drift Patterns (AVOID THESE)

Based on observed issues in this project:

**Pattern 1: Phantom API Calls**
```c
// WRONG - These functions don't exist!
ipc_create_queue(pid, &queue_id);
ipc_destroy_queue(queue_id);

// CORRECT - Use the ACTUAL API from ipc.h
ipc_process_init(pid);
ipc_process_cleanup(pid);
```
*Prevention*: READ the header file before calling functions from it.

**Pattern 2: Incomplete Fixes**
Claiming to fix something but only partially doing so (e.g., fixing code but not docs).
*Prevention*: After making a fix, grep for the old pattern everywhere.

**Pattern 3: Assumed Context**
Assuming functions exist based on naming conventions without verifying.
*Prevention*: Always verify by reading actual source files.

### Commit Message Format for AI Contributors

```
type(scope): description

Detailed explanation of changes.

AI-Contributor: Model-Name/Version
AI-Confidence: high|medium|low
AI-Verified: api-check,compile,docs
Co-Authored-By: Model Name <noreply@provider.com>
```

**AI-Contributor**: Model name (Claude-Opus-4.5, GPT-4, Gemini-3, etc.)
**AI-Confidence**: Self-assessed confidence level
**AI-Verified**: Comma-separated verifications performed

### Quality Tracking

AI contributions are tracked with these metrics:

| Metric | Target | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| API Accuracy | 100% | Function calls match existing APIs |
| First-Compile Success | 100% | Code compiles on first submission |
| Review Iterations | < 2 | Rounds before merge-ready |
| Doc Consistency | 100% | Docs match implementation |

### Verification Scripts

```bash
# Check API consistency (function calls vs declarations)
./scripts/check-api-consistency.sh

# Full pre-PR validation
./scripts/validate-contribution.sh

# Check for common drift patterns
./scripts/lint-check.sh
```

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge
We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors, regardless of:
- Experience level with operating systems
- Familiarity with quantum computing
- Background or identity
- Geographic location

### Standards
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy toward other community members

### Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C programming experience
- Basic understanding of operating systems concepts
- Familiarity with quantum computing concepts (helpful but not required)
- Cross-compilation tools (see Bootstrap Guide)

### Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/flaukowski/QuantumOS.git
cd QuantumOS

# Install dependencies
make install-deps

# Build and test
make && make run
```

### First Contribution
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests
5. Submit a pull request

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- **main** - Stable, releasable code
- **develop** - Integration branch for features
- **feature/*** - Feature branches
- **bugfix/*** - Bug fix branches
- **release/*** - Release preparation

### Commit Guidelines
Use conventional commits:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test additions/changes
- `chore:` - Build process or auxiliary tool changes

Examples:
```
feat(process): add process creation API
fix(memory): resolve page table mapping bug
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Code Review Process
1. All changes require review
2. At least one maintainer approval
3. Automated tests must pass
4. Documentation must be updated
5. Security changes require additional review

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines
- Follow Linux kernel coding style
- Use 4-space indentation (no tabs)
- 80-character line limit where practical
- Comment non-obvious code
- Use descriptive variable names

### C Code Style
```c
// Good example
int process_create(const char *name, uint32_t parent_pid, process_t **process)
{
    if (!name || !process) {
        return -EINVAL;
    }
    
    *process = kmalloc(sizeof(process_t));
    if (!*process) {
        return -ENOMEM;
    }
    
    memset(*process, 0, sizeof(process_t));
    strncpy((*process)->name, name, sizeof((*process)->name) - 1);
    (*process)->parent_pid = parent_pid;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Header Organization
```c
#ifndef FILENAME_H
#define FILENAME_H

#include <kernel/types.h>
#include <kernel/memory.h>

/* Constants */
#define MAX_PROCESSES 1024

/* Type definitions */
typedef struct process process_t;

/* Function declarations */
int process_create(const char *name, uint32_t parent_pid, process_t **process);

#endif /* FILENAME_H */
```

### Documentation
Use Doxygen-style comments:
```c
/**
 * @brief Create a new process
 * 
 * @param name Process name (must be null-terminated)
 * @param parent_pid Parent process ID
 * @param process Output pointer to created process
 * @return int 0 on success, negative error code on failure
 * 
 * @note The caller is responsible for freeing the process with process_destroy()
 */
int process_create(const char *name, uint32_t parent_pid, process_t **process);
```
