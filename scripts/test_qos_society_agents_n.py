"""QuantumOS N-way society-of-societies gate (societies epic, increment 3;
epic #178 generalized to N>2). Stdlib-only: drives QosSociety directly and never
imports `mcp`, so it runs in CI with no pip.

Boots THREE attested QuantumOS VMs, each with BOTH the `agentdemo` token AND the
coupling wire, and proves — anti-vacuously — the useful cross-node WORK product
at N>2 (not just phase sync):
  1. each VM runs its OWN complete agent society locally (spawn-assembled
     specialists, content consensus, division of labor, and the qseed-salted
     AGGREGATE handoff — the full AGENTD: DEMO OK conjunction, per VM);
  2. the three societies EXCHANGE results over FSYP full-mesh: each VM's COM1
     shows the OTHER TWO members' aggregates (N-1 = 2 per node). Attribution is
     by VALUE — the host recomputes each member's expected aggregate from the
     compile-time phrase + workspace digits + that boot's qseed, and the FIXTURE
     pre-check requires all three expected values PAIRWISE-DISTINCT, so a
     forged/looped-back local value cannot satisfy a peer assertion (the FSYP
     print carries no source field; the distinct qseed-salted value IS the
     attribution — FSYP frames stay source-IP-filtered/unauthenticated per
     ADR-0019, and this host recomputation is their integrity check);
  3. every field still synchronizes under the demo load (the existing society
     property), on a GENEROUS budget — three agentdemo boots (a QPU job, four
     spawns, field ops each) ride the same VMs (the #171 timing lesson);
  4. shutdown reaps all three QEMU processes.

NEW gate rather than an extension of test_qos_society3.py, so the demo-free
society3/society4 gates keep their timing (the #178 design-review finding).
