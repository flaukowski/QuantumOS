Scheduler perf/stability baseline gate (ADR-0022, prerequisite 2).

ADR-0022 root-caused the agent-tool latency floor to the scheduler cadence and DEFERS
the fix behind two prerequisites. Prereq 1 (the COM2 latency gate, test_qos_latency.py)
shipped. This is prereq 2: a perf/stability baseline so a future scheduler-constant
change (the deferred fix) is MEASURED, not blind (ADR-0016 anti-vacuous discipline).

THE METRIC (design-panel-refined, calibration-selected): the design panel's red-team
refuted the naive metric. Aggregate context switches (`switches`) are dominated by
VOLUNTARY yields — every long-lived citizen busy-yields, resetting the quantum counter
thousands of times per 10 ms tick, so the timer-preemption path is nearly dead at rest.
switches/tick is therefore BOTH quantum-insensitive (a gate on it is vacuous) AND host-CPU
dependent (flaky on slow CI). The kernel instead exposes a DEDICATED `preempt` counter,
incremented ONLY on timer-quantum expiry (never on SYS_YIELD). PR-1's calibration confirmed
preempt-per-1000-guest-ticks = ~1000/quantum, host-invariant (~200 at q=5 idle+load with
<0.5% variance, ~50 at q=20). So this gate ASSERTS that scalar in [FLOOR, CEIL] (see the
constants below) — plus a non-vacuous LIVENESS floor so it also reddens on a dead/wedged/
frozen scheduler. Everything asserted is a delta over GUEST ticks, so a slow CI runner reads
the same value (it just takes longer wall-clock to fill the window).

Env:
  QOS_KERNEL       path to kernel.elf32 (else the bridge default)
  QOS_SCHED_LOAD   "1" to drive continuous COM2 PING load while sampling (default idle)
  QOS_SCHED_TICKS  target guest-tick window to accumulate before reporting (default 3000)

Run:  python3 scripts/test_qos_sched.py            # idle baseline
      QOS_SCHED_LOAD=1 python3 scripts/test_qos_sched.py   # under-load baseline
Gate: make ci-smoke-sched
