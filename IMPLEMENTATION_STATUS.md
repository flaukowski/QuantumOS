## v0.2 - Core Functionality 🔄 IN PROGRESS

### Definition of Done
A feature is complete for v0.2 when:
1. **Code compiles** - `make` succeeds with no errors
2. **API consistency** - `./scripts/check-api-consistency.sh` passes
3. **Smoke test passes** - `make ci-smoke` boots successfully
4. **Documentation updated** - Header comments and doc files reflect API
5. **No deprecated patterns** - No calls to removed/renamed functions

### Components

#### IPC System ✅ MERGED
- [x] Message queues per process
- [x] Named ports for service discovery
- [x] Zero-copy shared memory regions
- [x] Bidirectional channels
- [x] Quantum-safe extensions (circuit handoff, measurement propagation)
- [x] **API Consistency Verified** (PR #10)

#### Process Management ✅ MERGED
- [x] Process creation and destruction
- [x] Process state management
- [x] Priority-based scheduling
- [x] Process relationships (parent/child)
- [x] Quantum-aware process support
- [x] **IPC integration verified** (PR #10)

#### Capability System ⏳ PLANNED
