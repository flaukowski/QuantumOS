"""N-way authenticated swarm-plane gate (epic #139 + ADR-0019): prove a
host-admitted group session key gates the FIELD-COUPLING wire across a THREE-VM
mean-field society — the N>2 generalization of the 2-VM ci-smoke-keyauth.

Stdlib-only: drives QosSociety directly (never imports `mcp`), so it runs in the
integration CI job with no pip. Needs qemu + host multicast.

THE CENTRAL CORRECTION (why this gate does NOT assert on R_x / SYNCHRONIZED):
an R_x-based "the keyless node is excluded" claim is VACUOUS. A keyless receiver
skips the have_key MAC guard and ACCEPTS everything, so a keyless C in a
2-keyed+1-keyless mesh becomes a ONE-WAY Kuramoto follower — it phase-locks to
A/B's authenticated frames and prints R_x>=0.80 + SYNCHRONIZED while its OWN
zero-tag frames are rejected by A/B. All three print SYNCHRONIZED with the key
withheld. R_x discriminates nothing.

The REAL discriminator is frame-ADMISSION, offset-anchored at each member's FSKEY:
  leg (a) EXCLUSION — key A,B only. On A AND B: the FSAUTH bad-MAC line appears
    (C's zero-tag frames rejected) AND the per-source 'frame from C' count STOPS
    growing (delta==0 past the key boundary). POSITIVELY confirm C still receives
    fresh frames from A/B (the one-way lock — documented, not a failure).
  leg (b) ADMIT — key C too (SAME group key). Fresh 'frame from C' lines RESUME
    on A AND B (offset-anchored past C's FSKEY); THEN the whole society synchronizes
    (await_sync_n anchored past the keying boundary — a fresh sync, not a stale
    pre-key SYNCHRONIZED read off the sticky log).
  leg (c) REPLAY (real) — the host joins the society's mcast group, captures one
    member's live FSYN datagram verbatim, waits >1s, and re-sends it. The receiver
    sees a VALID MAC + a STALE seq and prints the per-reason replay line (needs
    increment 0's per-reason split — a shared flag would have swallowed it behind
    the bad-MAC line). Then a 2nd admit prints the rekey line.

Revert-confirms (documented in the Makefile gate):
  - skip the leg-(b) admit  -> frame-from-C never resumes + sync times out (red).
  - collapse the per-reason flag back to one shared latch -> leg (c) replay marker
    never prints (swallowed behind leg (a)'s bad-MAC line) (red).
