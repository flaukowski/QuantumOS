/**
 * QuantumOS ATA PIO Block Driver (epic #71 phase 1)
 *
 * A minimal polled driver for the primary-master ATA disk (I/O base
 * 0x1F0, control 0x3F6), LBA28 only. This is the persistence substrate:
 * the writable RAM filesystem serializes itself to this disk on
 * SYS_SYNC and is restored from it at boot.
 *
 * Design constraints, in the house tradition:
 *  - Every hardware wait is BOUNDED (the console_write lesson): a
 *    wedged controller costs a bounded spin and an error return, never
 *    a hung kernel.
 *  - A diskless boot degrades honestly ("ATA: no disk — persistence
 *    disabled") and changes nothing else — the default -kernel CI path
 *    boots exactly as before.
 *  - Kernel-internal only: ring 3 never touches sectors. Filesystem
 *    write authority is a capability over DEVICE_ID_DISK, checked at
 *    the syscall layer; the block device itself has no user surface.
